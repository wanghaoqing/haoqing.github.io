#### I have a multidisciplinary background that includes structural biology, biochemistry, and computational sciences. During my PhD studies at Caltech, I worked in Prof. Pamela Bjorkman’s group to study the structural dynamics of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and how antibodies recognize it. Using single particle cryoEM and cryo-electron tomography, I resolved the conformational changes of Env during receptor and coreceptor engagement. These results contribute to the understanding of how HIV-1 infect target cells through membrane fusion. Besides, I’m also interested in translational research. I participated in a clinical collaboration with Prof. Michel Nussenzweig’s group at Rockefeller University to characterize antibodies isolated from HIV-1 infected patients. These studies shed light on strategies for antibody engineering as well as vaccine design. Currently I work in Prof. Brian Kobilka’s group at Stanford University as a postdoc. I’m applying my expertise in structural biology to study μ-opioid receptor and using structural knowledge to design μ-opioid receptor analgesics with attenuated side effects.

### Conformational changes of HIV-1 Env trimer during viral fusion

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1 ">

I’ve also studied the structural dynamics of HIV-1 Env by solving structures of Env in prefusion and receptor-bound states, described a detailed structural biology model of Env-mediated membrane fusion. Structural study of HIV-1 Env in receptor-bound state was known to be challenging due to its dynamic property. To overcome this issue, I used a combination of bNAbs to stabilize the complex of Env and CD4 receptor. This strategy enabled us to obtain atomic resolution structures of CD4 receptor-bound Env. These structures answered some fundamental questions, such as how HIV-1 Env undergoes conformational changes during receptor and coreceptor engagement and how these conformational changes could lead to viral-host cell membrane fusion.

### Broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 virus

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">


Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) neutralize HIV-1 virus by targeting Env glycoprotein on viral surface. Previous studies have suggested that administration of bNAbs after HIV infection can lead to viral clearance in animal models. In order to understand the neutralizing mechanism of these bNAbs, structural studies are essential. My early work focused on characterizing bNAbs isolated from HIV-1 patients. As a graduate student in Bjorkman lab, I have solved multiple structures of patients’ bNAbs in complex with Env glycoprotein. These results not only demonstrated the neutralizing mechanism of bNAbs, but also revealed novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. The knowledge of how bNAbs recognize epitopes on HIV-1 Env can guide antibody engineering as well as vaccine design.
