<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a structural biologist with a special interest in emerging computational and experimental methods in electron microscopy. I am working as a postdoc with [Danielle Grotjahn](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/grotjahn/), using cryo-electron tomography of focused ion beam-thinned cells to quantify mitochondrial morphology and solve _in situ_ protein structures. In particular, I am excited about the power of electron tomography to contextualize the structure, dynamics, and interactions of proteins as they perform their physiolocal function in the cell.    
I received my PhD in biophysics from UCSF in the lab of [James Fraser](http://fraserlab.com), where I developed methods for the building and validating atomic models generated from single particle electron microscopy, as well as investigating the mechanisms of activity of mammalian chitinases. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Biological Chemistry, where I worked with [Elizabeth Sattely](http://www.stanford.edu/group/sattelygroup/cgi-bin/wordpress/) investigating bacterial degradation of the plant polymer lignin.   
Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about food and cooking, coffee, 3D printing, and games.
