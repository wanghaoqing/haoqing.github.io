<p class="lead text-justify">
I'm the assistant director of cryoEM at [Sarafan ChemH Knowledge Center](https://chemh.stanford.edu/research/knowledge-centers) to support users with cryoEM & cryoET solutions. 
Before this I'm a AHA postdoctoral fellow in [Brian Kobilka](https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab.html) lab working on the structure-based drug discovery of opioid receptors. 
I received my PhD from Caltech in the lab of [Pamela Bjorkman](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~bjorker/), where I studied the structure and dynamics of HIV-1 Env. 
Before that, I was an undergraduate at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I worked with [Zhihong Guo](https://chem.hkust.edu.hk/people/zhihong-guo-guozhihong).  
While I'm not doing research, I enjoy spending time with my family.
